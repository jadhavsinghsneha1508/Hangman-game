Hangman Game - Guess the Fruit!

A simple, fun, and classic **Hangman** game implemented in Python where the player has to guess a secret fruit name by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.

**Short Overview:**
A simple **command-line Hangman game** in Python that:
- Randomly picks a fruit name from a predefined list.
- Gives the player `length of word + 2` chances.
- Shows underscores for unguessed letters.
- Accepts one letter at a time, validates input (only single new letters).
- Reveals correct letters in their positions.
- Uses `Counter` to detect when the full word is guessed.
- Ends with **"You won!"** if guessed correctly or **"You lost!"** + reveals the word if chances run out.
Basic but functional fruit-themed Hangman (with a few small bugs in the display/win-check logic).

Features
- Randomly selects a fruit from a predefined list
- Gives a hint that the word is a fruit
- Provides `word length + 2` guessing chances
- Input validation (only single letters, no repeats)
- Clean display of correctly guessed letters
- Win/Lose conditions with the secret word revealed at the end
- Graceful handling of KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C)

| **Language**          | Python 3                                | Core programming language |
| **Standard Library**  | `random`                                | Randomly select the secret word |
| **Standard Library**  | `collections.Counter`                  | Compare guessed letters with word (handles duplicates) |
| **Input/Output**      | `print()` and `input()`                 | Display game state and get user guesses |
| **String methods**    | `.split()`, `.isalpha()`, `.count()`    | Process word list and validate/input handling |
| **Exception handling**| `try-except` (ValueError & KeyboardInterrupt) | Prevent crashes on bad input or Ctrl+C |
| **Control flow**      | `while`, `for`, `if-elif-else`, `break` | Game loop and logic |
| **Data structures**   | `str`, `list` (implicit)                | Store word and guessed letters |
No external libraries or frameworks** – pure Python standard library only.  
Very lightweight and beginner-friendly.

Steps to install and run this hangman game 
Here are the **super-simple steps** to run this Hangman game on your computer (works on Windows, macOS, or Linux):
1. **Make sure Python is installed**  
   - Open your terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows)  
   - Type:  
     ```
     python --version
     ```  
     or  
     ```
     python3 --version
     ```  
   - If you see something like `Python 3.8+`, you're good.  
   - If not, download and install Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. **Create the game file**  
   - Open any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, Sublime, etc.)  
   - Copy the entire Hangman code you posted earlier  
   - Save it as: `hangman.py`  
     (Important: file name must end with `.py`)

3. **Run the game**  
   - Open terminal/command prompt  
   - Navigate to the folder where you saved `hangman.py`  
     Example:  
     ```bash
     cd Desktop
     cd Games
     ```  
   - Then run:  
     ```bash
     python hangman.py
     ```  
     or on some systems:  
     ```bash
     python3 hangman.py
     ```

That’s it! The game will start immediately.
**No installation of extra packages needed** — everything used (`random`, `collections`) comes built-in with Python.

Quick Testing Instructions

1. Save the code as `hangman.py`  
2. Open terminal / command prompt in that folder  
3. Run:  
   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```
   (or `python3 hangman.py`)

**Test Cases to Try Right Away** (just type these letters one by one):

| Secret Word (example) | Fast Win (type these letters) | Fast Lose (type wrong letters) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| apple                 | a → p → l → e                 | x → z → q → k → m → n → … (until chances = 0) |
| banana                | b → a → n                     | x → z → q → w → …             |
| mango                 | m → a → n → g → o             | x → z → q → …                 |

**What to Check Quickly**:
- Underscores appear correctly at start  
- Correct letters reveal in the right places  
- Wrong guess → chances decrease  
- Repeated letter → “You have already guessed that letter”  
- Win → “Congratulations, You won!”  
- Lose → “You lost! … The word was …”

That’s all! Run it 2–3 times with the above inputs and you’ve fully tested it.

How to Play
1. Run the script.
2. A secret word (a fruit name) is chosen randomly.
3. You’ll see underscores representing each letter of the word.
4. Enter one letter at a time to guess.
5. Correct letters are revealed in their proper positions.
6. You have **length of word + 2** chances.
7. Guess the full word before running out of chances to win!

 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses only built-in `random` and `collections.Counter`)
