PROBLEM STATEMENT
Develop a simple, interactive command-line Hangman game in Python where the secret word is always the name of a fruit, 
randomly chosen from a predefined list each time the game is played. The program must initially display the word as a series 
of underscores representing each unguessed letter and grant the player a limited number of attempts equal to the length 
of the secret word plus two extra chances. The player guesses one letter at a time; the input must be strictly validated to 
accept only single alphabetic characters, reject repeated guesses with a clear message, and ignore invalid entries
(numbers, symbols, or multiple characters) without penalizing the player. Correct guesses reveal the letter in all its correct positions, 
while incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts. The game ends with a win and congratulatory message if the player fully uncovers
the word before running out of attempts, or with a loss message revealing the correct word if attempts are exhausted.
The program should handle unexpected interruptions gracefully and rely solely on Python’s standard library, delivering a
clean, engaging, and bug-free fruit-themed Hangman experience.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
Simple single-player, text-based Hangman game in Python that randomly picks a fruit name, lets the user guess letters with `word length + 2` attempts,
shows progress, validates input, and declares win/loss — pure console, no graphics, no extra features. Lightweight, beginner-friendly, educational script using only standard Python.

TARGET USERS
- Python beginners learning loops, strings, conditionals, and input handling  
- Students/teachers using it as a simple classroom coding example or exercise  
- Anyone who wants a quick, no-install, text-based game to play in the terminal for fun  
- Hobbyists looking for a minimal Hangman script to modify or extend  

Perfect for learners and casual terminal gamers — not aimed at advanced users or those wanting graphics/multiplayer.
