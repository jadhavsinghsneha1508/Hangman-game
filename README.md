# Hangman-game
This Python program plays a Hangman game by randomly selecting a fruit name. It displays blanks for each letter and allows the user to guess letters within limited chances. Correct guesses reveal letters, and the game ends when the player completes the word or runs out of attempts, showing win or loss.
